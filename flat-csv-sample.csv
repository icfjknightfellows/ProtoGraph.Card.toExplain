Elections,What does the election mean for Brexit and what does Brexit mean for the election?,"It is unlikely that the result will affect Brexit, with both Tories and Labour saying they will enact the referendum result, though if Labour wins we might be more likely to see a “soft Brexit” as opposed to a hard one. A number of MPs campaigned differently from the way their constituency voted, for example the Labour MP for Vauxhall, Kate Hoey, who backed Brexit, while only 22% of her constituents voted to leave. While nationally Labour campaigned for remain, many traditionally Labour constituencies voted to leave. How this plays out in the general election remains to be seen."

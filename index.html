A number of MPs campaigned differently from the way their constituency voted, for example the Labour MP for Vauxhall, Kate Hoey, who backed Brexit, while only 22% of her constituents voted to leave. While nationally Labour campaigned for remain, many traditionally Labour constituencies voted to leave. How this plays out in the general election remains to be seen."

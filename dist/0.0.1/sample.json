    "explainer_text":"It is unlikely that the result will affect Brexit, with both Tories and Labour saying they will enact the referendum result, though if Labour wins we might be more likely to see a “soft Brexit” as opposed to a hard one. A number of MPs campaigned differently from the way their constituency voted, for example the Labour MP for Vauxhall, Kate Hoey, who backed Brexit, while only 22% of her constituents voted to leave. While nationally Labour campaigned for remain, many traditionally Labour constituencies voted to leave. How this plays out in the general election remains to be seen."
